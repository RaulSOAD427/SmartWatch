## SmartWatch

Me and my partner incorporated emany aspects of a smartwatch into one project. The design of it was created using a state machine that is communicated from the Microcontroller, to the ESP32, then back. The watch switched from each section to another. We created this pseudocode in order to organize our code and make it a lot more pheasible.
